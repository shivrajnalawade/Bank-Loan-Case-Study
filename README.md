# Bank-Loan-Case-Study
 As a finance company data analyst, I use EDA to minimize defaults from applicants with limited credit history. Balancing lost business and financial loss risks, I analyze customer data, focusing on payment difficulties. The goal is to inform decisions, ensuring fair approvals and mitigating risks. #DataAnalysis #RiskMitigation #Finance
